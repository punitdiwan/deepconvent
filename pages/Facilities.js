We believe that not all students are alike and do not learn information in the same way. Therefore, as the child learns in unison with the class, he/she may experience an accommodation or modification to the curriculum or classroom setting to best fit their learning needs. Depending on individual needs, each child’s academic, social, and emotional background will be recognized and supported with a team approach from the teachers, the reading specialist, the guidance counselor, the speech pathologist, the academic coach and the administration.

Learning centers focused around these skills may provide tutors who can help with the skill process, editors who will edit papers and resources such as citation guides, practice worksheets or read-a-long stations. Providing students with a skill-based learning center helps them build confidence in their abilities and allows them to seek out help outside of the classroom if they are stuck.
